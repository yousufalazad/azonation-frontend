              <p>
                An Individual Account lets you join and participate in one or more organisations within Azonation. It represents you as a person—your identity, membership, and engagement across the platform.

              <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-1">How does it work?</h3>
              <p>
                Once signed up, you can request to join organisations, respond to invitations, manage your personal profile, and track your activity, membership roles, and contributions in real time.
              </p>

              <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-1">Why do I need one?</h3>
              <p>
                You need an Individual Account to engage with any organisation using Azonation. It provides you access to events, projects, communication tools, and personalised dashboards.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h3 class="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-1">What if I don’t have one?</h3>
              <p>
                Without an Individual Account, you won't be able to join organisations or access any membership-related features. Signing up is free, easy, and takes less than a minute.

              <p>
                Yes, you can join multiple organisations using a single Individual Account. You can switch between them easily, each with its own roles, privileges, and activities.

                Keep your profile complete with an updated photo, short bio, and relevant information. It helps organisations recognise you and assign you appropriate roles or responsibilities.
